# Project 1 Exploring User Intereaction
Digital literacy within AI chatbots is becoming a blurry line, especially with added anthropomorphized design features such as tone, empathy, or warmth. Often, users feel a false sense of security due to the social presence theory or the computers are social actors paradigm. Articles mention that users increasingly are disclosing personal identifyable information, which leads to privacy concerns. For this project, I wanted to explore how users would interact with a chatbot asking them about their personal information to solve the case of Jane, an AI researcher, disappearing. The goal was to connect the importance of digital literacy when interacting with an AI chatbot to maintain a balance of using chatbots as tools.
